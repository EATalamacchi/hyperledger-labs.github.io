# Certified Anonymous Identities in Hyperledger Fabric

# Scope of Lab
The scope of this lab is to achieve an implementation of Hyperledger Fabric where the user may decide to remain anonymous thanks to a cryptographic protocol but can give a certified proof sharing some kind of information (for example age, eye color etc.) given the proof that information is true thanks to a special consesus algorithm.
