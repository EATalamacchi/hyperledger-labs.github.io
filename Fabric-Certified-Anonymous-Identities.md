# Lab Name
Certified Anonymous Identities in Hyperledger Fabric

# Short Description
Issues related with identity management to date have not been really investigated by the research community. Past work has mainly focused on the problem of credential management, and approaches have been developed specifically dealing with anonymous credentials.

# Scope of Lab
The scope of this lab is to achieve an implementation of Hyperledger Fabric where the user may decide to remain anonymous thanks to a cryptographic protocol but can give a certified proof sharing some kind of information (for example age, eye color etc.) given the proof that information is true thanks to a special consensus algorithm.
